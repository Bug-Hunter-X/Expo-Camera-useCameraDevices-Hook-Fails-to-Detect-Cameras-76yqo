# Expo Camera useCameraDevices Hook Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Expo's `useCameraDevices` hook intermittently fails to detect available cameras on the device.  The issue leads to a blank screen or an error message in the application, preventing camera functionality.

## Bug Description

The `useCameraDevices` hook, part of Expo's Camera API, is supposed to provide a list of available camera devices. However, under certain conditions, this hook returns an empty array, even when cameras are physically present and functional.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains a minimal reproduction of the issue.  Run the app on a physical device or emulator to observe the erratic behavior.

## Solution

The proposed solution, detailed in `bugSolution.js`, involves adding error handling and retry logic. While not a perfect fix for the root cause of the problem, it mitigates the issue by gracefully handling cases where `useCameraDevices` initially fails to detect cameras.
